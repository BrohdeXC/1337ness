## Notes and Tips
If permutate has problems with certain text files, check to make sure the file does not have CRLF line terminators.  
```bash
$ file <file.txt>
Good: <file.txt>: ASCII text
Bad: <file.txt>: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators
```
To get rid of them in vim:  
```vim
:set fileformat=unix
:w
```

## Known Issues and Planned Updates
Issue: CRLF line terminators cause problems when permutating certain text files  
Planned: Advanced Settings for instant hashing  
Planned: Get column size at beginning and format output accordingly  
Planned: Add an option to format wordlists and make them line by line
